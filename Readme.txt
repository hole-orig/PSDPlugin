When I recompiled the PSDPlugin source code with .NET7, I encountered some errors.
Therefore, I made some modifications as suggested by the development environment, 
confirmed that the error disappeared and that it worked properly, and decided to redistribute it.
However, I am not the original developer and cannot add features or directly fix bugs.
note that.



Photoshop PSD FileType Plugin for Paint.NET


Description
------------

This plugin allows Paint.NET to load and save Photoshop .PSD files.

Perfect round-trip compatibility is possible for features that are
common to both Paint.NET and Adobe Photoshop.  Other features are
preserved with varying levels of visual fidelity.

Installation

1. Exit all instances of Paint.NET.
2. Copy Photoshop.dll into the C:\Program Files\Paint.NET\FileTypes
   directory.
3. Restart Paint.NET, which will automatically detect the plugin.
